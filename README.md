# Awe

- Awe is a curated collection of standalone, interactive Material 3 desktop widgets built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/) for Linux and Wayland compositors.

## MJW desktop widget set (`plugins/`)

The end4-PC desktop widgets, ported to Ryoku as plugin packages and published in
the [Ryostore](https://github.com/ryoku-dev/ryostore) catalogue:

`mjw-clock`, `mjw-calendar`, `mjw-worldclock`, `mjw-media`, `mjw-notes`,
`mjw-todo`, `mjw-timer`, `mjw-visualizer`, `mjw-weather`, `mjw-resources`,
`mjw-usercard`, `mjw-text`, `mjw-image`, `mjw-sticker`, `mjw-image-converter`.

Each folder under `plugins/` is one package: `manifest.json` for the host,
`content/` for the widget's QML and its own config/persistence, `service/` for
anything it runs, `assets/` for its preview. They install through Ryostore and
run on the Ryoku desktop; the widgets at the repository root are the standalone
Awe shell and are unaffected.

`plugins/**` is ported from end4-pC and is therefore GPL-3.0-only, with its own
`LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `PROVENANCE.md` in each folder. The Boost licence at the
repository root covers the standalone shell only.

- Each widget is an independent QML component that can be moved, scaled, customized, and toggled across your desktop with persistent configuration.
